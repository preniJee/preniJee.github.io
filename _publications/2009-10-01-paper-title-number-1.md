title: "Social-Group-Agnostic Bias Mitigation via the Stereotype Content Model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-07-01-SCMD
excerpt: 'Existing methods typically rely on word pairs specific to certain social groups, limiting their effectiveness to one aspect of social identity. This approach becomes impractical and costly when addressing bias in lesser-known or unmarked social groups. Instead, we proposed leveraging the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), a framework from social psychology. The SCM categorizes stereotypes along two dimensions: warmth and competence. By adopting this social-group-agnostic perspective, we demonstrated comparable performance to group-specific debiasing methods while offering theoretical and practical advantages over existing techniques.'
